What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?
A2. 

**difference between JPA and Hibernate**

-> JPA is specification given by java people to build ORM software.
 -> At a time of building ORM software devloper have to use JPA api.
-> While Hibernate is one of the famous implementation of JPA. Hibernate have their own api too.
-> that means in hibernate besides jpa methods their own methods and classes is also there.
-> hibernate is ORM framework software.
-> JPA belongs to javax.persistence and Hibernate belong to org.hibernate package.

**advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC**

->The first and major advantage is in JDBC we can't store java objects directly to database.we have
   convert object into atmoic value to store in database table.

->JDBC depend on database software because we write query which depend on database software 
while in hibernate we write query in JPQL language which depend on Class name and variable
name.so it make hibernate database software independent.

->In JDBC too much repetation of some code like a big boiler plate code but in hibernate this problem 
is solved. 

->In JDBC there are so many checked exceptions is there we have to take care all the checked 
exception.

->In JDBC we get ResultSet to store our database data.but this resultset we are not able transfer our
data from one layer to another layer.(total 3 layer is there)
